Challenge Set 1
 This sets cover basics data types and combination of different techniques around it to write
 python program.– This is curated for Python class students specifically for batch of 19nov (3:00 PM Group)

 1. Numbers and Floats
 Write a Python function that takes two numbers (integers or floats) as input
 and returns:
 ● Their sum
 ● Their difference
 ● Their product
 ● Their division (handle the case where division by zero might occur).

 2. Strings
 Write a Python program that:
 ● Takes a string as input.
 ● Reverses the string.
 ● Counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.
 ● Converts the string to uppercase.

3. Lists
 Write a Python function that:
 ● Accepts a list of integers as input. (use split method)
 ● Returns the largest and smallest number in the list.
 ● Removes duplicates from the list.
 ● Sorts the list in descending order.

 4. Tuples
 Write a Python function that:
 ● Takes a tuple of integers as input.
 ● Returns a new tuple with only the even numbers from the original
 tuple.
 ● Converts the tuple into a list and adds a new element to it.

 5. Dictionaries (Basics)
 Write a Python program that:
 ● Creates a dictionary with keys as numbers from 1 to 5 and values as
 their squares.
 ● Prints all the keys and values.
 ● Updates the value of key 3 to 27.
 ● Deletes the key 5 from the dictionary.

6. String and Dictionary Combination
 Write a Python function that:
 ● Takes a string as input.
 ● Counts the frequency of each character in the string and stores it in a
 dictionary.
 ● Ignores spaces and considers case-insensitive comparisons.
